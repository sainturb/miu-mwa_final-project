# MWA-Final-Project-October-2022
### Final Project
### Application specifications and requirements
It’s up to you to decide your project specs and requirements. Take your time to plan your project idea, write down a short description for it, set your goals, and have a clear scope. Your project must use the following:  
* ✅ Implement a login-based system (JWT).  
  
Note: Chat and e-commerce/cart applications are not allowed. Set a more challenging goal.
  
### Technical information
* ✅ You must use all the technologies we learned in our course (MEAN stack).
* ✅ Design your own DB, skeleton, and app structure (let me know if you need help with this). Start by planning your screens. (use DB as a service – Atlas).
* ✅ All Angular routes should be protected from public access by JWT (except sign-up and sign-in routes)
* ✅ All Express routes should be protected from public access by JWT (except sign-up and sign-in routes)
* ✅ A daily push is required to track your code and performance. If you miss a push that will affect your final grade.
* ✅️ Do not push any private key of any service to Git. (If found, your account will be terminated and you may be legally sued by service providers). Write your keys in a config file (npm i dotenv) and add the filename to .gitignore
* ✅ Do not spend more than two hours on a problem, move on, or find an alternative.
  
### Notes and daily routine
You are free to work from any comfortable spot you may choose and are not required to come or to be in the classroom. I'm available to assist you any day through Teams from 10:00 AM to 12:30 PM, and from 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM. The classroom will be open and available all days.
    
### Final Evaluation
The last push should be performed before Tuesday 9 pm. I will meet with every team individually on Wednesday and Thursday mornings and evaluate the final project code, the meetings' schedule and invites will be sent later. 
  
Send me an email to asaad@miu.edu on Tuesday before 9 pm with the following:
* ❗️ A summary of the project idea.
* ❗️ A list of all problems/solutions/new things you learned during the project. 
* ❗️ Your daily schedule.
* ❗️ Copy/paste your config file (all secret keys) and include that in the email.
  
### To qualify for 1 extra point to be added to your final grade, your project must include the following as pre-requisites:
* ✅ Using featured lazy-loaded modules in the frontend and proper REST design in the backend.
* ✅ Using Angular Material for UI components and project layout (or other Angular UI Kits). This does not mean using a few components but rather having the project layout meet the industry standards in web design.
  
Once your project meets the pre-requisites, you are eligible to earn 1 extra point when your project includes all of the following features:
* ❌ Using state management library (NgRx) or any other similar state management solution (Redux).
* ✅ Using AWS S3 or any other similar service for image upload (backend and frontend).
* ✅ Your project is hosted online and accessible with a public URL.
  
During the project evaluation session, please let me know that you have completed any of the above, you will have to demonstrate a deep understanding of the above points, so I could check the above points and determine your eligibility for extra points.
  
Good luck and happy coding!
  
Groups should not work with each other or share or copy code from any source. Remember to respect the code honor submission policy. All written code must be original.
